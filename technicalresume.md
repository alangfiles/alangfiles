Currently located in Columbus, Ohio, with 8+ years of professional programming experience. Interested in data analytics, software design, and web development. I've mainly worked in 5-10 person teams, from developer to architect on various projects, over a variety of software platforms (from Java and C# standalones to JavaScript-based Single Page Applications). I enjoy learning new technologies and trying to push my limits on both gathering new knowledge and the accurate application of what I already know.

## Exhaustive Experience

### Startups.com
Built various tools for engaging startup founders. Worked on a highly skilled, very small team (3 engineers!) to manage 7 websites, build new products and features, and technically support at 50 person organization. On such a small team, being autonomous and taking ownership of products was crucial, as well as working with the whole company (from designers to CEO) to finalize specs of a product in flight.

* **Startups.com Founder Groups**  
  Built a fast growing new community based product, based on a low-code solution so it could quickly scale and be used by a non-technical team. Product grew to $1M MMR in just under 1 year. Went through 3 iterations, from being a Node/React style forum, to a Airtable/Zoom/Slack product, and then pulling some of those features back (custom chat and invite/scheduling system).

* **Startups.com Rewrite**  
  Convert the old legacy site for startups.co to the newly purchased .com domain. Rebuilt the site with Webpack, Node.js, React, GraphQL, and a custom visual design library. Deployed in Docker containers on AWS.

* **Startups.com Design Library**  
  Created a new custom visual design library of components to work with React for quick building pages. Built off some base components (`<Container/>`, `<Text/>` and various `<Layouts/>`) quick designs could be made using the default props, and deeper changes could be made to any component through a robust prop system. Built with CSS-in-JS (Emotion), and published/consumed as an internal npm package.

* **Startups.com Security Audit**  
  Compiled a security audit against npm packages used in our main projects, as well as reviewing and testing our API endpoints.

## Improving, Inc: Consulting firm
A tech consulting firm in Columbus, Ohio. 200 employees at the time, my responsibilities were at client locations, as well as interviewing new employees, interviewing at clients, and teaching / mentoring consultants.

* **Improving Client: IGS, Energy Resale – Customer facing Website**   
Worked with a team of four, in an agile process, to convert legacy code to new production code. The original site was written in AngularJS, and I was one of the developers moving the application to React with Redux. Other responsibilities: 
Working closely with the Marketing department for requirements and approval
Working on a high profile site that generates revenue for the business
Helping use Scrum practices to organize work and goals
Using React with Redux to produce a more stable, testable site

* **Improving Client: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation – Spatial Data**  
Managed a team that worked out of Columbus, Ohio, with a team of subject matter experts in Houston, Texas to build a Process Flow tracking piece of software that tracked the lifecycle of a Mapping Survey. The application was built with Angular4, Java SpringBoot and Leaflet/Esri maps. Some of the other details included:
Requirements gathering, project proposal, and sprint planning
Interacting with clients, users, and interdepartmental organizations to achieve goals
Connecting and refactoring a legacy non-relational database
Using Angular 4 with Leaflet.js to build a solid user experience

### AIC Kapsowar Hospital: 
Worked for 14 months at a rural Kenyan hospital. Helped with development and implementation on an Open Source Hospital Management Software (https://github.com/openhmis), and this involved becoming familiar with many of the hospital’s processes:
Requirements gathering for pharmacy’s inventory and the clinician’s interface for prescriptions
Understanding and creating a process for multiple payment and insurance plans at the cashier.
Conforming the hospital’s processes to the software’s workflow, and training users.
As the sole IT worker at the hospital, I was involved in many diverse tasks:
Transitioning surgical logbooks into a digital format and creating analytics from it
Wiring CAT5 cable in the hospital, and setting up Wireless Access Points for full coverage
Hiring and training a new IT tech for the hospital
Building a new website for the hospital (www.kapsowarhospital.org)

Notable achievements: 3rd place in an Internal Inventor competition, for a visual / tonal language learning system.

* **Battelle Client: CDC Public Health Tracking Network**  
Developed and maintained a public portal for 30+ years of Public Health data in the U.S. Worked with an HTML5 frontend, and a separate Flash/Flex tool connected to a SQL backend. I helped guide this site through a transition from a very web 1.0 version to a more adaptable backend design.
Site built on Java/STRUTS
Created a spinoff HTML5 Single Page App (http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/InfoByLocation/)

Site built on Microsoft MVC3
Prototyped in Leaflet.js for simple mapping
Worked with OpenLayers and GeoServer
 
* **Battelle Internal: Genetic Sequencing Software**  
A genetic sequencing software to compare different FASTQ sequences, and to find interesting alignment results. With modules for Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms, Mitochondrial DNA, and mixtures.
Standalone Java desktop application
Modular design, created in Netbeans
Work in Java UI design
Learned about various genetic processes: Alleles, SNPS, INDELs

### Ohio State University: Senior Thesis Project
Latent semantic text search engine  
Java backend processing HTML search results of published papers (abstracts only).  
The abstracts were collected in XML, processed to retreive key words or importance, and then mapped in an n-dimensional space of those words. The front end accepted text through HTML and made a call to situate the user input in that n-dimensional space, and find all the abstracts closest to the user input. Exact semantic matching didn't need to occur, since linguistically close ideas should appear in the abstracts.
