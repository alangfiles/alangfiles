Currently located in Columbus, Ohio, with 8+ years of professional programming experience. Interested in data analytics, software design, and web development. I've mainly worked in 5-10 person teams, from developer to architect on various projects, over a variety of software platforms (from Java and C# standalones to JavaScript-based Single Page Applications). I enjoy learning new technologies and trying to push my limits on both gathering new knowledge and the accurate application of what I already know.

## Exhaustive Experience

### Improving Client: IGS, Energy Resale – Customer facing Website  
Worked with a team of four, in an agile process, to convert legacy code to new production code. The original site was written in AngularJS, and I was one of the developers moving the application to React with Redux. Other responsibilities: 
Working closely with the Marketing department for requirements and approval
Working on a high profile site that generates revenue for the business
Helping use Scrum practices to organize work and goals
Using React with Redux to produce a more stable, testable site

### Improving Client: Anadarko Petroleum Corporation – Spatial Data
Worked with a team of subject matter experts to build a Process Flow tracking piece of software that tracked the lifecycle of a Mapping Survey. The application was built with Angular4, Java SpringBoot and Leaflet/Esri maps. Some of the other details included:
Requirements gathering, project proposal, and sprint planning
Interacting with clients, users, and interdepartmental organizations to achieve goals
Connecting and refactoring a legacy non-relational database
Using Angular 4 with Leaflet.js to build a solid user experience

### AIC Kapsowar Hospital: 
Worked for 14 months at a rural Kenyan hospital. Helped with development and implementation on an Open Source Hospital Management Software (https://github.com/openhmis), and this involved becoming familiar with many of the hospital’s processes:
Requirements gathering for pharmacy’s inventory and the clinician’s interface for prescriptions
Understanding and creating a process for multiple payment and insurance plans at the cashier.
Conforming the hospital’s processes to the software’s workflow, and training users.
As the sole IT worker at the hospital, I was involved in many diverse tasks:
Transitioning surgical logbooks into a digital format and creating analytics from it
Wiring CAT5 cable in the hospital, and setting up Wireless Access Points for full coverage
Hiring and training a new IT tech for the hospital
Building a new website for the hospital (www.kapsowarhospital.org)
 
### Battelle Client: CDC Public Health Tracking Network 
Developed and maintained a public portal for 30+ years of Public Health data in the U.S. Worked with an HTML5 frontend, and a separate Flash/Flex tool connected to a SQL backend. I helped guide this site through a transition from a very web 1.0 version to a more adaptable backend design.
Site built on Java/STRUTS
Created a spinoff HTML5 Single Page App (http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/InfoByLocation/)
Created a custom CMS and front end editor in MVC
 
### Battelle Internal: Health Analytics Software 
A Health Analytics tool, written for the Web. Taking advantage of hospital data with heavy statistical analysis applied to help hospitals realize where they need to spend their time and money.
Involved from prototype to product in 6 months
Worked directly with industry professionals to build a desirable product
An HTML5, CSS, JavaScript project, built on Microsoft MVC4
Worked with many javascript libraries for charting and display
 
### Battelle Client: Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - GIS Mapping Site 
A mapping GIS website for heat and sun related data in Saudi Arabia. I helped to design a prototype for this site, and work with it to become a full project, taking in data from Saudi Arabia's monitoring stations, overlaying data from NREL, and comparing trends.
Site built on Microsoft MVC3
Prototyped in Leaflet.js for simple mapping
Worked with OpenLayers and GeoServer
 
### Battelle Internal: Genetic Sequencing Software 
A genetic sequencing software to compare different FASTQ sequences, and to find interesting alignment results. With modules for Single-nucleotide Polymorphisms, Mitochondrial DNA, and mixtures.
Standalone Java desktop application
Modular design, created in Netbeans
Work in Java UI design
Learned about various genetic processes: Alleles, SNPS, INDELs

### Ohio State University: Senior Thesis Project
Latent semantic text search engine  
Java backend processing HTML search results of published papers (abstracts only).  
The abstracts were collected in XML, processed to retreive key words or importance, and then mapped in an n-dimensional space of those words. The front end accepted text through HTML and made a call to situate the user input in that n-dimensional space, and find all the abstracts closest to the user input. Exact semantic matching didn't need to occur, since linguistically close ideas should appear in the abstracts.
