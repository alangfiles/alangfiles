## Alan Files
Currently located in Columbus, Ohio, with over 10 years of professional programming experience. Interested in data analytics, software design, web development, and helping engineers grow in their careers. I've mainly worked and lead in 5-10 person teams, from Engineer to Tech Lead on various projects, over a variety of software platforms (from Java and C# standalones to JavaScript-based Single Page Applications). I enjoy learning new technologies and trying to push my limits on both gathering new knowledge and the accurate application of what I already know. I also enjoy helping engineers level up their skills and find their niche in the programming world.

## Exhaustive Experience 

### Ribbon (ribbonhome.com) - Engineering Manager
**Tech Stack** Javascript/TS/React/GraphQL frontend with Python/Django Backend  
Joined a Real Estate startup in a hyper-growth stage (from 100 - 300 people) to help build new products focused around home selling. Transitioned into managing a technical documents/operations team. Worked on a platform serving over 40,000 real estate agents across 17 US states and 25 markets.


* **Documents/Expansion Team**  
   Lead a team of 3 senior engineers working on expanding our product to more states and worked on Machine Learning to recognize and extract values from user uploaded documents.
   * Moved the expansion process from a hard-coded dev-intensive process to a database configuration driven process. We were able to expand into new markets with no engineering time needed by the end of the process, just configuration setup by the subject matter experts.
   * Shipped a Machine Learning solution that would recognize and extract values from user uploaded real estate transaction documents and create matching models in our system.
   
* **Web Team**  
  Merged the Documents Team with the web product, streamlinging delivery on the new product. Switched to a more Agile methodology (after previously using 6 week cycles to 2 week scrum style sprints). Lead a team of 6 engineers (and an intern) through scrum ceremonies and 1-on-1's. Performed over 30 interviews ranging from Software Associates to VP of Engineering. Worked with Product Managers and Design to organize product work and bring it to completion through the engineering team.
  * Updated the process for Staff Engineer Interviews to increase the efficiency of the hiring funnel from the Hiring Manager interview by adding more technical questions and more space for questions from the interviewee.
  * Pull together a team of 7 Engineers from 3 different teams into a single new team, with team building exercises, career growth planning, and helping to organize pairing and unblocking to help level up engineers.

### Startups.com - Senior Software Engineer
**Tech Stack** Javascript/TS/React/GraphQL frontend with Node.js Backend  
Built various tools for engaging startup founders. Worked on a highly skilled, very small team (3 engineers!) to manage 7 websites, build new products and features, and technically support at 50 person organization. On such a small team, being autonomous and taking ownership of products was crucial, as well as working with the whole company (from designers to CEO) to finalize specs of a product in flight.

* **Startups.com Founder Groups**  
  Built a fast growing new community based product, based on a low-code solution so it could quickly scale and be used by a non-technical team. Product grew to $1M MMR in just under 1 year. Went through 3 iterations, from being a Node/React style forum, to a Airtable/Zoom/Slack product, and then pulling some of those features back (custom chat and invite/scheduling system).

* **Startups.com Rewrite**  
  Convert the old legacy site for startups.co to the newly purchased .com domain. Rebuilt the site with Webpack, Node.js, React, GraphQL, and a custom visual design library. Deployed in Docker containers on AWS.

* **Startups.com Design Library**  
  Created a new custom visual design library of components to work with React for quick building pages. Built off some base components (`<Container/>`, `<Text/>` and various `<Layouts/>`) quick designs could be made using the default props, and deeper changes could be made to any component through a robust prop system. Built with CSS-in-JS (Emotion), and published/consumed as an internal npm package.

* **Startups.com Security Audit**  
  Compiled a security audit against npm packages used in our main projects, as well as reviewing and testing our API endpoints.
 
* **Startups.com Properties**  
  Built and maintained new features, deployments, uptime, and user support for the following sites under the startups.com umbrella
  * www.fundable.com (fundraising) 
  * www.zirutal.com (zirtual assistants) 
  * www.launchrock.com (idea validation) 
  * www.clarity.fm (twilio-based expert calls)
  * www.bizplan.com (business plan / business consulting)

Requirements gathering, project proposal, and sprint planning
Interacting with clients, users, and interdepartmental organizations to achieve goals

### Ohio State University: Senior Thesis Project
Latent semantic text search engine  
Java backend processing HTML search results of published papers (abstracts only).  
The abstracts were collected in XML, processed to retreive key words or importance, and then mapped in an n-dimensional space of those words. The front end accepted text through HTML and made a call to situate the user input in that n-dimensional space, and find all the abstracts closest to the user input. Exact semantic matching didn't need to occur, since linguistically close ideas should appear in the abstracts.
